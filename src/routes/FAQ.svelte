                How many total NFTs of the {@html UCC} will be released?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                The artist and DMINTI will reserve a total of 20 NFTs directly
                as "artist proofs" and "print proofs". These NFTs will be minted
                at random during the opening private sales window beginning on
                April 29th and will be withdrawn from the 1,440 total editions,
                leaving a total of 1,420 editions available to the public. The {@html UCC}
                project is just the initial public offering from a larger body of
                work from the artist, who's practice also extends the concept and
                propietary color systems in both alphanumeric and geographical expressions
                as well addressing the concept of color blindness in future iterations.
